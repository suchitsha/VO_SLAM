For debugging:

ROS example throws error on build, add a line to cmake and solve the problem:
-lboost_system

Ok, I got confused. Remove all the flags in that CMakeList. I see that this CMakeList is the principal, you should do the changes in the ROS CMakeList. I think that is here: /home/teun/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2/CMakeList.txt

It should have this:

set(LIBS
${OpenCV_LIBS}
${EIGEN3_LIBS}
${Pangolin_LIBRARIES}
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../Thirdparty/DBoW2/lib/libDBoW2.so
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../Thirdparty/g2o/lib/libg2o.so
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../lib/libORB_SLAM2.so
-lboost_system
)
